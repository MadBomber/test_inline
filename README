ONLY use if you like to experiment. Who knows if this is a good idea :)

So the basic goal of this library is to allow you put your test right
next to the code being tested. For example:

  def multiply(a, b)
    a * b
  end

  Test do
    assert_equal 6, multiply(2, 3)
    assert_equal 10, multiply(5, 10)
    assert_not_equal 42, multiply(6, 9)
  end

We also offer nice Rails integration so you can use it in your apps.
